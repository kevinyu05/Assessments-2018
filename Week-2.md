#### 5. Name 4 semantic html tags. <nav>, <header>, <footer>, <table>

#### 6. What is block scope that became available in ES6? Include how it differs from javascript's local and global scope, and what variables are block scoped. 
 
 //Your Answer
 Blocked scope can only be accessed locally inside of a function that is nested inside of a function. 
 
 //Googled Answer
In block scope, any block will be a scope. This will give a more consistent behaviour. In ES6, let and const were introduced as   alternative ways of declaring variables â€” both being blocked scoped. For example, variables blocked inside of a function using Let or Const can only be accessed within the function even if the outer scoped variable has the same variable name. 
 
 #### 7. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?
 
 //Your Answer
Front-end web development is when the user can see and interact with a website or mobile application.
 
 //Googled Answer
Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to graphical interface for user to view and interact with data through digital interaction using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
 
 #### 8. Choose one of the new ES6 concepts we learned about this week (namely: block scope, classes, and string interpolation) and write example code that demonstrates the concept, with comments to explain what is going on. 
 let name = 'Paul';

if (true) {
  let name = 'Kevin';
  console.log(name); // 'Kevin'
}

This is an example of a blocked scope. Although both variable names are equal, the let name initialized inside of the if statement scope will be logged to the console because it is blocked within the if statement. 
 
 #### 9. What is the difference between a div and a span? 
 
 
 //Your Answer
 Div is used to to group larger portions and span is to group smaller portions 
 
 
 //Googled Answer
The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.
   
#### 10. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?
 
 
 //Your Answer
 Inheritance is way to pass properties through methods.
 
 //Googled Answer
 It is a mechanism where you can drive a class from another class for hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.
